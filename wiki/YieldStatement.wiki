#summary Python Yield statement support explained

Python has a very very nice [http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-yield_stmt yield statement].

Creating a Java port of python's [http://docs.python.org/release/2.7/library/itertools.html itertools] without a support for the same yield statement would be simple nonsense. 

= Getting Started =

Let assume you want to use the yield statement to generate the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number Fibonacci Suite].

This is what a Pythonista would do

{{{
	def fib():
	  i,j=1,1
	  yield j
	  yield i
	  while True:
	    i,j = i+j,i
	    yield i
}}}


Let's see how to do it in Java now, with neoitertools.


== the Body ==

Java is much more verbose than python, as it has to carry all the types all the way. So let's start focusing on the body implementation first

{{{
				int i=1;
				int j=1;
				yield(j);
				yield(i);
				while(true){
					i=i+j;
					j=i-j;
				    yield(i);
				}
}}}

It's not as _clean_ as python, but it's Java, and frankly, it's quite clean.

 
== the Object Definition ==

Java beeing pure object, it's not possible to define generators as function, so in neoitertools we provide a simple interface

{{{
	public interface Yield<R,V> {
		public void generate();
	}
}}}

where `R`, and `V` are used in the yield function as:
{{{
	public R yield(V value);
}}} 

Then, the body previously defined has a place to be:

{{{
	new Yield<Void, Integer>() {
			public void generate() {
				int i=1;
				int j=1;
				yield(j);
				yield(i);
				while(true){
					i=i+j;
					j=i-j;
				    yield(i);
				}
				
			}
		}

}}}

== the Generator ==


Itertools class provides both the `yield` function, and an `iter` function that turn the Yield object in a Generator. So the whole code is :

{{{
	Generator<Integer> g = iter(new Yield<Void, Integer>() {

			public void generate() {
				int i=1;
				int j=1;
				yield(j);
				yield(i);
				while(true){
					i=i+j;
					j=i-j;
				    yield(i);
				}
				
			}
		});
		
		System.out.println(  list(g, 10) );
}}} 

that procudes, as expected :
{{{ [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55] }}}

== Advanced Features ==

The real yield statement in python can be used to receive a value from the `next` call. We also provide support for this kind of yield: see YieldGenerator class.

But this feature is not compatible with any of the standard Java interfaces (like Iterator, or Iterable ).
